# Workout Tracker Memory Bank

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Workout Tracker application. These documents serve as the "memory bank" for the project, capturing requirements, architecture, and planning that can be referenced across different development sessions.

## Contents

### Core Documentation

- [Project Requirements](PROJECT_REQUIREMENTS.md) - Comprehensive overview of application features and requirements
- [System Architecture](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Technical architecture, component interactions, and API structure
- [Database Schema](DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) - Detailed database design with tables, relationships, and constraints
- [Development Roadmap](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) - Implementation phases and timeline for feature development
- [User Flows](USER_FLOWS.md) - Step-by-step user interaction flows for key application features
- [Implementation Summary](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Current implementation status and next steps
- [Workout Plan Implementation Guide](WORKOUT_PLAN_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) - Detailed guide for workout plan functionality
- [Weight Conversion System](WEIGHT_CONVERSION_CONSOLIDATED.md) - Documentation for the weight unit conversion system

## How to Use This Memory Bank

This memory bank is intended to be referenced when:

1. **Starting new development sessions** - Quickly get context on what has been planned and what has been implemented
2. **Onboarding new developers** - Provide comprehensive project overview
3. **Making architectural decisions** - Ensure consistency with the planned architecture
4. **Prioritizing features** - Reference the roadmap for implementation order
5. **Resolving uncertainty** - Find authoritative answers on how features should work
6. **Tracking progress** - Review what has been implemented and what remains to be done

## Development Approach

The project follows an incremental development approach:

1. Phase 1: Core infrastructure and authentication (âœ… Completed)
2. Phase 2: Exercise and workout plan management (âœ… Completed)
3. Phase 3: Workout session flow (âœ… Completed)
4. Phase 4: Data tracking and visualization (âœ… Completed)
5. Phase 5: Advanced features like sharing and PWA capabilities (âœ… Completed)
6. Phase 6: Refinement and testing (ðŸ”„ Current Phase)
7. Phase 7: Deployment and post-launch activities (Planned)

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Frontend**: React with Material UI for responsive design and PWA capabilities
- **Backend**: FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- **Deployment**: Docker and Docker Compose for containerization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication system
- **Mobile Strategy**: Mobile-first design with PWA capabilities rather than native apps

## Current Implementation Status

The application is currently in Phase 6 (Testing and Refinement). All core functionality has been implemented, and the application is being actively tested in a real-world workout tracking scenario. Key features completed include:

- User authentication and profile management
- Exercise management with categorization
- Workout plan creation, sharing, and activation
- Workout session tracking with set/rep/weight logging
- Progress visualization with charts and statistics
- Mobile-responsive design for use on various devices
- Weight unit conversion system (kg/lbs)

Current focus is on testing, fixing edge cases, and preparing for deployment. See the [Implementation Summary](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) for a detailed breakdown of what has been implemented and what remains to be done.

## Quick Start (When Project is Initialized)

To start development:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd workout-tracker

# Start the development environment
docker compose up --build
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

## Contributing Guidelines

1. Reference these documentation files before making significant changes
2. Update documentation when architecture or requirements change
3. Follow the established patterns for consistency
4. Prioritize features according to the roadmap
5. Update the implementation summary when completing major features
