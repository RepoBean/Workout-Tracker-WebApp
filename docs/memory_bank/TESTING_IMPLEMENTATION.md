# Workout Tracker - Testing Implementation

This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the Workout Tracker application.

## Backend Testing Setup

### Completed Components
- **Testing Framework**: Set up pytest with configuration in pytest.ini
- **Test Database**: Configured SQLite in-memory database for testing
- **Test Fixtures**: Implemented fixtures for database sessions, client, and authentication
- **Patching Mechanism**: Created a database patching approach to override the PostgreSQL connection

### Backend Test Coverage
- **Auth Endpoints**: Comprehensive tests for registration and login
  - User registration validation
  - First user becoming admin automatically
  - Duplicate username validation
  - Login with valid credentials
  - Login with invalid credentials
- **API Health Check**: Basic test for the root endpoint
- **Current Coverage**: 47% overall coverage, with 97% coverage for auth endpoints

### Backend Testing Tools
- **pytest**: Main testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Support for async tests
- **SQLite**: In-memory database for tests

## Frontend Testing

### Planned Setup
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **Mock Service Worker**: API mocking
- **Testing Utilities**: Custom render function with providers

### Planned Test Coverage
- **Authentication Components**: Login and Registration forms
- **Navigation**: Routing and protected routes
- **Form Validation**: Input validation and form submission
- **Dashboard Components**: Layout and data display

## Test Execution

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_auth.py -v
```

### Frontend Tests (Planned)
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- -t "Login Component"
```

## Next Steps in Testing Implementation

1. **Backend Testing Expansion**:
   - [ ] Implement tests for user management endpoints
   - [ ] Create tests for exercise management CRUD operations
   - [ ] Add tests for workout plan endpoints
   - [ ] Test workout session tracking
   - [ ] Verify progress calculation endpoints

2. **Frontend Testing Setup**:
   - [ ] Configure Jest and React Testing Library
   - [ ] Create mock services for API endpoints
   - [ ] Implement testing utilities for component rendering

3. **Frontend Component Testing**:
   - [ ] Test authentication components (Login, Register)
   - [ ] Verify navigation and routing functionality
   - [ ] Test form validations and submissions
   - [ ] Validate dashboard components and layouts

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - [ ] Test API integration with frontend components

## Continuous Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool
- [ ] Configure automated test runs on pull requests
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

## Current Status
As of the current implementation, the backend testing infrastructure has been set up with pytest and SQLite, and authentication endpoint tests have been implemented. The next priority is to expand backend tests to cover more endpoints and implement frontend testing.
