# Workout Tracker - Testing Implementation

This document outlines the testing strategy and implementation for the Workout Tracker application.

## Backend Testing Setup

### Completed Components
- **Testing Framework**: Set up pytest with configuration in pytest.ini
- **Test Database**: Configured SQLite in-memory database for testing
- **Test Fixtures**: Implemented fixtures for database sessions, client, and authentication
- **Patching Mechanism**: Created a database patching approach to override the PostgreSQL connection

### Backend Test Coverage
- **Auth Endpoints**: Comprehensive tests for registration and login
  - User registration validation
  - First user becoming admin automatically
  - Duplicate username validation
  - Login with valid credentials
  - Login with invalid credentials
- **API Health Check**: Basic test for the root endpoint
- **Workout Plan Endpoints**: Tests for workout plan functionality 
  - Creating workout plans (with and without exercises)
  - Setting and retrieving active workout plans
  - Adding exercises to workout plans
  - Updating exercise configuration in workout plans
  - Removing exercises from workout plans
  - Reordering exercises within workout plans
- **Current Coverage**: 
  - 47% overall coverage across all endpoints 
  - 97% coverage for auth endpoints
  - 61% coverage for workout plan endpoints

### Backend Testing Tools
- **pytest**: Main testing framework
- **pytest-cov**: Code coverage reporting
- **pytest-asyncio**: Support for async tests
- **SQLite**: In-memory database for tests

## Frontend Testing

### Completed Setup
- **Jest**: JavaScript testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **Mock Service Worker**: API mocking
- **Testing Utilities**: Custom render function with providers in `src/utils/test-utils.js`

### Frontend Test Coverage
- **Authentication Components**: Tests for Login component
- **Workout Plan Components**: Tests for CreateWorkoutPlan and WorkoutPlans components
- **Exercise Components**: Tests for ExerciseSelector
- **Mock Implementation**: Mock API calls, navigation, and context providers

### Common Testing Patterns
- Using Jest mocks for components and API functions
- Setting up fake timers to handle setTimeout calls
- Using data-testid attributes for targeting components
- Proper act() wrapping for asynchronous operations
- Mock implementations for child components

### Fixed Issues
- Corrected import paths in test files
- Fixed mock implementations for components
- Improved error handling mocks
- Added proper mock function setup order
- Implemented fake timers for time-based navigation
- Corrected test expectations for component interactions

## Test Execution

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest --cov=app

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_auth.py -v
```

### Frontend Tests (Planned)
```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd frontend

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- -t "Login Component"
```

## Next Steps in Testing Implementation

1. **Backend Testing Expansion**:
   - [ ] Implement tests for user management endpoints
   - [ ] Create tests for exercise management CRUD operations
   - [x] Add tests for workout plan endpoints
   - [ ] Test workout session tracking
   - [ ] Verify progress calculation endpoints

2. **Frontend Testing Setup**:
   - [ ] Configure Jest and React Testing Library
   - [ ] Create mock services for API endpoints
   - [ ] Implement testing utilities for component rendering

3. **Frontend Component Testing**:
   - [ ] Test authentication components (Login, Register)
   - [ ] Verify navigation and routing functionality
   - [ ] Test form validations and submissions
   - [ ] Validate dashboard components and layouts

4. **Integration Testing**:
   - [ ] Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
   - [ ] Test API integration with frontend components

## Continuous Integration
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI tool
- [ ] Configure automated test runs on pull requests
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting

## Current Status
As of the current implementation, the backend testing infrastructure has been set up with pytest and SQLite. Authentication endpoint tests have been implemented, and workout plan endpoint tests have been added with good coverage (61%). The next priority is to expand backend tests to cover more endpoints and implement frontend testing.
