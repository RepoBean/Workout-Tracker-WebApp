## Weight Conversion System Improvements

The weight unit conversion system has been refined to address inconsistencies:

1. **Separation of Conversion and Display**:
   - Conversion functions operate with full precision
   - Rounding only occurs at display time
   - Database stores precise values in kg

2. **Standardized Approach**:
   - Eliminated special case handling for specific exercises
   - Consistent conversion logic across the application
   - Clear function responsibilities (conversion vs. display)

3. **UI Consistency**:
   - Weight displays are consistent across all views
   - Input and output follow the same conversion rules
   - User's preferred unit system is respected throughout

See [Weight Conversion System](WEIGHT_CONVERSION_CONSOLIDATED.md) for detailed documentation.

## Sequential Workout Progression Implementation

The sequential workout progression feature allows users to follow their workout program in the intended sequence, regardless of the current calendar day.

### Key Components
1. **Backend API Endpoint**: 
   - `/api/sessions/plan/{plan_id}` - Retrieves all sessions for a specific workout plan
   - Supports filtering by status parameter
   - Returns sessions sorted by date for determining progress

2. **Frontend API Utility**:
   - `sessionsApi.getByPlan(planId, status)` - Gets sessions by plan ID with optional status filter

3. **Progression Logic**:
   - `determineNextWorkoutDay()` function in ActiveWorkout.js
   - Examines completed sessions and determines the next day in sequence
   - Handles progression looping (restart after last day)

4. **Session Initialization**:
   - Modified `initializeSession()` to use sequential logic instead of calendar day
   - Works with both active plans and specifically selected plans

### Benefits
- Users can follow their workout program in the intended sequence
- Missed workout days don't disrupt the program flow
- Users can workout on any schedule that suits them while maintaining proper program progression

## Active Plan Implementation

### Key Features
- Modified User model to include `active_plan_id` field referencing the active workout plan
- Updated API endpoint `/api/plans/{plan_id}/activate` to set the user's active plan 
- Modified plan response schema to include `is_active_for_current_user` flag
- Allows multiple users to have the same workout plan as their active plan
- Each user's progress through a plan is tracked independently
- Improves UI by clearly showing which plan is active for the current user

### Benefits
- More intuitive user experience with personalized "Active" indicators
- Supports community features where popular plans can be used by many users simultaneously
- Maintains individual progress tracking for each user
- Aligns with typical workout app behavior where users select programs from a library

### Implementation Details
- Added foreign key from users.active_plan_id to workout_plans.id
- Modified activate endpoint to check for plan access (own plan or public)
- Updated the "next" workout endpoint to use the user's active_plan_id
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing frontend code

## Database Implementation

### Completed Components
- **Models**: All database tables defined with relationships
- **Indexes**: Performance optimization with indexes on frequently queried fields
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management
- **Seed Data**: Comprehensive exercise library and sample workout plans

### Pending Database Tasks
- Implement migrations for schema changes
- Configure production database settings
- Set up backup strategy

## Current Testing Status

Testing is currently in progress with 46% backend code coverage. Authentication endpoints are well-tested, while workout plan functionality has partial coverage with some failing tests. The failing tests are related to the workout plan activation feature, where tests are checking for an `is_active` property directly on workout plans, while the actual implementation uses the user's `active_plan_id` field.

### Test Coverage by Area
- Authentication: ~97%
- User Management: ~53%
- Workout Plans: ~44%
- Exercises: ~21%
- Sessions: ~14%
- Progress: ~13%
