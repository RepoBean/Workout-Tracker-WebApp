## Critical Issues and Development Priorities (Updated)

### Core Functionality Issues

#### Workout Plan Creation and Exercise Assignment
- **Current Issue**: Exercise assignment to specific days is counterintuitive
- **Current Issue**: Days per week selection doesn't allow specifying which days
- **Current Issue**: UI allows adding exercises to "Unassigned days" which is confusing
- **Current Issue**: When configuring exercises after selecting a specific day, UI still allows changing the workout day
- **Improvement Needed**: Allow adding exercises directly to specific days
- **Improvement Needed**: Add explicit day selection (Mon/Tue/Wed etc.) during plan creation
- **Improvement Needed**: Remove or clarify the "Unassigned days" option

#### Active Workout Session Issues
- **Current Issue**: Exercise names not displayed during active workout
- **Current Issue**: No display of total sets/reps or target weight during workout
- **Current Issue**: Cannot add multiple sets for an exercise
- **Current Issue**: Weights and reps not auto-populated from plan configuration
- **Current Issue**: Exercise progression is rigid without ability to navigate between exercises
- **Fix Required**: Display exercise names prominently during workout
- **Fix Required**: Show planned sets/reps/weight and allow overriding them
- **Fix Required**: Implement multiple set tracking per exercise
- **Fix Required**: Auto-populate weights/reps from workout plan

#### Exercise Display Problems
- **Current Issue**: Workout plans page shows "0 exercises" when exercises exist
- **Current Issue**: Exercise names not clearly displayed on plan detail view
- **Current Issue**: Dashboard "next workout" section doesn't show exercises
- **Fix Required**: Review data retrieval and display logic for exercises across the application

#### Workout Session Initialization
- **Current Issue**: "No exercises found" error when starting a workout
- **Current Issue**: Broken connection between active plans and new workout sessions
- **Fix Required**: Debug data flow from "start workout" to session initialization
- **Fix Required**: Ensure exercises from active plan are properly loaded into new sessions

#### Network Connectivity
- **Current Issue**: Connection refused error when accessing from other devices (localhost:8000/api/auth/login)
- **Fix Required**: Modify Docker configuration to bind to all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- **Fix Required**: Ensure frontend is configured to use correct backend URL for external access

### Development Approach

#### Database Management Strategy
- For development phase, prioritize recreating the database rather than implementing migrations
- Update models with needed changes, then drop and recreate database
- Update seed files to populate with test data
- Implement proper migrations later when schema stabilizes

#### Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Fix network connectivity issues to enable testing from external devices
2. Address workout plan creation and exercise assignment flow
3. Fix exercise display across the application
4. Correct workout session initialization
5. Implement proper error handling and user feedback
6. Then proceed with previously identified priorities (export functionality, PWA features)

#### Deferred Priorities
- Database migrations implementation (deferred until schema stabilizes)
- Export functionality (JSON workout plans, CSV history)
- PWA offline functionality
- Expanded test coverage
