## Current Testing Status (as of June 2024)

Current backend test coverage is at 46% with 21 tests (18 passing, 3 failing). Authentication endpoints have nearly 100% coverage, while workout plan functionality has partial coverage. The failing tests are related to workout plan activation, where tests are checking for an `is_active` property directly on workout plans while the actual implementation uses a user's `active_plan_id` field.

### Key Testing Priorities
1. Fix tests for workout plan activation to match the current implementation
2. Add coverage for exercise management endpoints
3. Implement session tracking tests
4. Add progress calculation endpoint tests

## Development Priorities (Next Steps)

1. Fix failing workout plan activation tests
2. Complete missing PWA functionality
3. Implement remaining data export features
4. Create database migrations
5. Expand test coverage
6. Prepare for initial deployment

### Deferred Priorities
- Comprehensive frontend testing
- Database migrations (until schema stabilizes)
- Advanced PWA offline functionality
- Integration with third-party services
